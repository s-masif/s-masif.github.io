* I am currently working as a Researcher at Healthcare Technology Core, College of Dentistry, Chosun University. Here I am working on the development of XR-based multi-user training platform for clinical practice training using C# and Unity.

* Before joining here, I completed my MS in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://eng.chosun.ac.kr/eng/index.do" target="_blank">Chosun University</a>, Gwangju, South Korea in February 2023. During this time, I worked as a graduate research assistant in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Mobile-Computing-Lab-Sangman-Moh" target="_blank">Mobile Computing Lab</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kVQbNIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Sangman Moh</a>.

* Prior to my masters, I completed my bachelors's in Computer Science and Engineering from East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019. After that, I worked as a Programmer at <a href="http://tecbsl.com/" target="_blank">Technology and Business Solution Limited</a> for one year where I worked on developing web applications using C# and ASP.NET.
